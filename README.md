## Install & try (under a minute)

**1. Download the binary** for your OS (no repo clone needed):

```bash
# Linux
curl -sSL https://github.com/geval-labs/geval/releases/latest/download/geval-linux-x86_64 -o geval && chmod +x geval

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -sSL https://github.com/geval-labs/geval/releases/latest/download/geval-macos-aarch64 -o geval && chmod +x geval

# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/geval-labs/geval/releases/latest/download/geval-windows-x86_64.exe -OutFile geval.exe
```

**2. Run the built-in demo** (no files needed):

```bash
./geval demo
```

You’ll see a decision report and get **PASS**, **REQUIRE_APPROVAL**, or **BLOCK**. Same binary works in CI — no npm or pip. [→ Use in CI](geval/docs/github-actions.md)

**Using your own files** (e.g. after cloning the repo for examples):

```bash
./geval check --signals path/to/signals.json --policy path/to/policy.yaml --env prod
```

**If the download fails** (e.g. no binaries for your OS yet), **build from source** (requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geval-labs/geval.git && cd geval
cargo build --release --manifest-path geval/Cargo.toml
./geval/target/release/geval demo
```

## The problem

Your team runs **evals** (evaluations that measure AI quality — accuracy, relevance, safety, hallucinations, latency). You also have A/B tests, human review, and business metrics. When you change a model or a prompt, you get a flood of signals:

- **Evals** say: “Accuracy improved.”
- **A/B** says: “Engagement dropped a bit.”
- **Review** says: “Edge case flagged.”

So: **do you ship or not?** Today that call often happens in Slack or a meeting — inconsistent, hard to audit, and easy to forget. Geval gives you **one place to write the rules** and **one clear answer** every time: **ship**, **get approval first**, or **block**.

---

## What Geval does

**Geval is a decision engine for AI releases.** You feed it the outcomes of your evals and other signals (as simple data files). You define your policy in a single file: *“If engagement drops, block. If hallucination rate is above X, block. If retrieval quality is below Y, require human approval.”* Geval applies those rules in a fixed order and returns:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **PASS** | Good to ship. No rule blocked it. |
| **REQUIRE_APPROVAL** | A rule says a human must approve before shipping. |
| **BLOCK** | A rule says do not ship until the issue is fixed. |

Every run is recorded (which policy and signals were used, which rule fired, when). So product managers, engineers, and auditors can always answer: *“Why did we ship this?”* and *“Who approved it?”*

**In short:** evals and other tools answer *“What happened?”* Geval answers *“Given what happened, are we allowed to ship?”*

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| `geval demo` | Run built-in example (no files). **Use this first after downloading.** |
| `geval check` | Run your signals + policy → PASS / REQUIRE_APPROVAL / BLOCK (exit 0 / 1 / 2) |
| `geval explain` | Show why (which rule, which signals) |
| `geval approve` / `geval reject` | Record human approval or rejection |
| `geval validate-policy` | Validate policy file |
